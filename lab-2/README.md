### Lab 02 - Data Analysis with NumPy & Pandas
-----

The following **NumPy** and **Pandas** tutorials would provide some help - 

* **[Python NumPy Tutorials](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)**

* **[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)** 

<br/>

For more information on **k-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm** read this article - 

* **[A Quick Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm](https://medium.com/@adi.bronshtein/a-quick-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-62214cea29c7)**

This algorithm would be formally covered in the lectures in Week 5.
